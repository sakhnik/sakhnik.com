This site is to leave notes for the future about programming, computers,
operating systems and IT in general.

Here is my resume: [sakhnik.pdf](/assets/sakhnik.pdf).

Here is the list of software I use and recommend:

* [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) — best GNU/Linux distribution,
simple, elegant, well-documented, rolling-released
* [neovim](https://neovim.io/) — a clone of the
[Vim](https://vim.sourceforge.io/) editor
* [ledger](http://ledger-cli.org/) — plain text finance accounting, simple and
powerful
* [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/) — The GNU Privacy Guard (here is my [public
key](/assets/sakhnik.pub.txt))
* [MSYS2](http://www.msys2.org) — a software distro and building platform for Windows

If you'd like to comment, don't hesitate to drop me an email.
