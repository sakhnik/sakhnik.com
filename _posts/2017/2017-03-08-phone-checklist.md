Upgrading [crdroid](https://plus.google.com/communities/118297646046960923906)
on my [LG G2](http://www.lg.com/ua/mobile-phones/lg-G2-D802) means wiping cache,
data, system, thus effectively doing factory reset every time.

Prior to upgrade:

* Check SMS are backed up
* Check enough battery
* Check correct firmware has been downloaded from xda-developers
[thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/lg-g2/development/rom-crdroid-t3120790)
* Download latest [gapps](http://opengapps.org/), preferably pico variant

After the upgrade:

* Configure WiFi, login to Google and restore settings from the cloud
* Configure launcher appearance and behaviour: big icons without labels, search
enabled, compact view, vertical fast scroller etc
* Configure screen settings: rotation and _LiveDisplay_
* Configure alarm clock
* Wait until applications are installed from the Google Play
* Connect [SMS Backup
+](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zegoggles.smssync) to
Google account
* Disable stock applications like mail, calendar and web browser
* Configure _cLock_'s calendar to show upcoming events
* Enable Google Messaging as SMS application
* Enable Google voice input method
* Login and authorize instant messaging applications
* Turn on bluetooth and pair it with _whatever_.
