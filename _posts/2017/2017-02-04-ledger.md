After ten years of everyday use of
[GnuCash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GnuCash), I finally came to the true
Unix technology: [plain text](http://plaintextaccounting.org/) for the log, and
command line utilities to query it.

There are my concerns with GnuCach:

* Transactions can be logged and queried only within the application
* The log consumes space on the encrypted storage (~4 MB after 3 years)
* Takes time to open
* Once hit a bug: couldn't save new transactions, had to go for sqlite file format
* I need a tiny fraction of GnuCash functionality.

And there I came across a post [ledger is
awesome](http://www.tivasyk.info/2017/02/ledger-is-awesome.html). The idea is
brilliant! There are tools to create ledger log from GnuCash: [on the
wiki](https://github.com/ledger/ledger/wiki/GnuCash-Import). Three-year history
occupies 800 Kb of plain text (Cyrillic, utf8). It took a minute to start new
log with the same equity.

One more goody: [vim-ledger](https://github.com/ledger/vim-ledger) to let vim
know syntax and semantics of the log file. Illustration:
