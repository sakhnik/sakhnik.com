One more essential tool needed for development in C++ is debugger. While I have
been quite productive with bare bone GDB and its TUI, still felt like missing
few convenient features: code navigation (where to put a breakpoint?), syntax
coloring, custom keymaps. Few years ago I found the plugin
[Conque-GDB](https://github.com/vim-scripts/Conque-GDB), which served pretty
well in Vim. However, it hasn't been updated for a while, and doesn't work well
in neovim.

So looking around, I first considered
[neogdb.vim](https://github.com/huawenyu/neogdb.vim). It is a new
plugin, but what's even more promising is that it was derived from the source
code of neovim:
[neovim\_gdb.vim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/5bb4139e6c98539564431de105dc9e0d06e207ac/contrib/gdb/neovim_gdb.vim).
The former started developing abstractions and interfaces away from GDB, which
isn't what I really needed. However, the latter is extremely simple, and easy to
adapt.

Meet [nvim-gdb](https://github.com/sakhnik/nvim-gdb). It's a thin wrapper around
GDB, and thus should be very flexible if I need to script gdb to automatically
attach to a process, for instance. I will continue developing the plugin while
already applying it in day-to-day work.
