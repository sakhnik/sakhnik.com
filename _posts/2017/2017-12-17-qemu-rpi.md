When I first packaged [Kerberos.io](https://kerberos.io/) for [Arch Linux
ARM](https://archlinuxarm.org/), I merely adapted binaries built for Raspbian
(see the [kerberosio-alarm](https://github.com/sakhnik/kerberosio-alarm)). It
worked for a while until I upgraded to the version 2.4.0 as the machinery
service started to crash. Apparently, due to lost ABI compatibility. So it's
time to build the application from the source code. Building on Raspberry PI is
impractical due to limited resources, and setting up cross-compilation tools
requires a great deal of accuracy. Luckily, I encountered a quick workaround:
use qemu-user to allow running native compiler on an x86_64 machine (see [the
original post](http://kbeckmann.github.io/2017/05/26/QEMU-instead-of-cross-compiling/)).

To automate setting up and launching the shell, I prepared the repository
[scripts](https://github.com/sakhnik/scripts) with the shell script
[arch-qemu-rpi.sh](https://github.com/sakhnik/scripts/blob/master/arch-qemu-rpi.sh) in
it.

Then the Kerberos.io [machinery](https://github.com/kerberos-io/machinery) can
be built either for x86_64 or for armv7h from AUR
[kerberosio-machinery](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/kerberosio-machinery/).

One step further is to go install and configure
[distcc](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Distcc) in the ALARM and
cross-build distccd in x86_64 as described in the same article. Now the
compilation will be substantially faster, because while the preprocessing will
be done under qemu, the actual compilation will be conducted in the host system.
