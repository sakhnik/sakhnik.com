Took the course [Algorithms, Part
I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/home/welcome) on
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), spent 3 weeks on video lectures,
programming tasks in Java (see [github](https://github.com/sakhnik/coursera_algo1)).
There follows my impression and conclusion.

* Took me three weeks to accomplish
* Enjoyed it a lot
* Repetition is the mother of learning, [etc
etc](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/887600-repetition-is-the-mother-of-learning-the-father-of-action)
* The practical tasks and examples of algorithm applications became most
interesting for me
* Their grader is an example of a good test suite

Looking forward for another programming course now.
