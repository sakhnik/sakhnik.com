One more linux around when I installed [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org) onto my
[TL-WR740N](http://www.tp-link.ua/uk/download/TL-WR740N.html). It happened just
out of curiosity, but now practical benefits start to show up.

* It's a full-featured linux with SSH, busybox packed with instruments
* Web interface can be switched on and off potentially sparing resources for
other applications
* IPv6 support out of the box
* The functionality is noticeably richer
* DNS is now available for LAN, thus obsoleting
[MDNS]({% post_url /2017/2017-03-29-mdns %})

Now the question is how stable OpenWrt will be.
