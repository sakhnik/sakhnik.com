Developing and testing remotely via RDP is challenging, especially through half
the globe. Still deployment can easily be automated without fancy commercial
programs. Here is how I installed and configured
[OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) on a Windows station.

* Install [MSYS2]({% post_url /2016/2016-11-18-win7-msys2 %}): go to
  [msys2.org](http://www.msys2.org/), download installer and run it
* Launch mingw64 shell
* Download the [recipe](https://gist.github.com/samhocevar/00eec26d9e9988d080ac)
* Execute it with debugging output: `bash -x msys2-sshd-setup.sh`
* If error happens, fix the script (for instance, I had to comment out `passwd
  -e` because of initially missing file `/etc/passwd`)
* Ensure Windows firewall allows incoming connections for sshd
* ???
* PROFIT

The rest is the matter of technique: [SFTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SFTP),
[rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/) whatsoever.
