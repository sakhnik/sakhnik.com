The most useful vim plugin for C++ coding, in my opinion, is
[vim-rtags](https://github.com/lyuts/vim-rtags), which utilizes clang-backed
[rtags](https://github.com/Andersbakken/rtags). Rtags parses code, builds index
for precise navigation.

Rtags is accurate, if code compiles. But it will fail with preprocessed code
bits. For instance, if there are separate pieces for linux and for windows, only
one of them will be compiled at a time.

The feature, which impressed me the most is "rename symbol under cursor". That's
already a feature of IDE: refactoring.

Note: to reduce SSD wear I tend to use `tmpfs` for transient data everywhere.
