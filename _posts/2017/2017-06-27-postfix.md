Apparently, configuration of outgoing mail is more than just installing postfix
because of anti-spam measures. Consider my pet project
[iryska.com.ua](https://iryska.com.ua): it did send emails as required, but I
suspect most of them ended up in Spam folders of the recipients.

The solution wasn't straight forward, but iterative:

* Get the score and recommendations from [mail-tester.com](https://www.mail-tester.com)
* Google how to resolve the most critical problem
* Fix it
* Repeat until satisfied with the result

Thus, the following had to be fixed:

* [SPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework) records in DNS
* [MX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MX_record) records in DNS
* [DKIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail)
* Postfix configuration

And there is the result now:
