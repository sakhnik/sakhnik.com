## How to deploy directory tree flat

Here is the catch: `Copy`, `Sync`, `Zip` etc preserve directory structure when
doing their job. If you needed to copy files from subdirectories into a single
directory, you would need to specify collection of files manually:

```
task deploy(type: Sync) {
	from 'src'
	into 'dst'
}

task deploy_flat(type: Sync) {
	from(fileTree(dir: 'src').files)
	into 'dst_flat'
}
```
