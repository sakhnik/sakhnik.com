Took the course [Algorithms, Part
II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2) on
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) (remember [Part I]({% post_url
/2017/2017-08-03-algo1 %})), spent 4 weeks on video lectures, programming tasks
in Java (see [github](https://github.com/sakhnik/coursera_algo2)).
Again, enjoyed the experience a lot, recommend to everybody!
