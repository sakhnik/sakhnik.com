I tried [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/ide/) to simplify my development
experience for C++. There is a lot of things I liked about it:

* Shiny responsive GUI with bells and whistles
* Function arguments hint in the code editor
* Easy code navigation: go to declaration, find usages etc
* Integrated debugger
* Automated project management for CMake

And for sure the whole idea of getting project configured, built and debugged
just out of the box is very attractive. However, I did encounter challenging
things too:

* Generic projects still have to be configured manually (consider gradle build)
* Code completion may become unstable for some reason, showing errors in every
line randomly
* There is no [fuzzy](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTCREATORBUG-3111) search
yet
* [Catch]({% post_url /2016/2016-12-03-cpp-unit-testing %}) C++ test framework
isn't well integrated (jump to the first error?)
* Not to mention I'm still more productive with [neovim](https://neovim.io/)

Then the realization happened that we have had all this in Vim for quite a long
time, but it just needed to be set up manually. This may be a tedious and
distracting process. Luckily, it could be easily automated the way Qt Creator
handles generic projects. So meet `cproj`, a system to handle generic C++
projects within my [dotfiles](https://github.com/sakhnik/dotfiles):

* [ycm-update.sh](https://github.com/sakhnik/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/.bin/ycm-update.sh)
will prepare a compact [YouCompleteMe]({% post_url /2016/2016-11-03-ycm-deployment %})
deployment with correct system includes in `~/.vim/includes.txt`

* [cproj-init](https://github.com/sakhnik/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/.bin/cproj-init)
executed in project root will create a template directory `.cproj` with `files`
and `cflags` in it

* [cproj-scan](https://github.com/sakhnik/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/.bin/cproj-scan)
executed in project root will create a compilation database in `.cproj.out` and
add the project to [rtags]({% post_url /2017/2017-01-08-vim-rtags %})
(it's convenient to have `rdm` socket-activated in systemd)

* Finally, YCM will
[load](https://github.com/sakhnik/dotfiles/blob/df8f68efb3267b2c73c81ed6da9f5000ef19db0e/vim/.vim/ycm_extra_conf.py#L79)
the same project settings!

So I'm likely to go further with both neovim for productivity and Qt Creator for
curiosity and inspiration. But clearly Vim is still the best.
