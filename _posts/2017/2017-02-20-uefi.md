I've just bought a new laptop HP Notebook 15 and spent an hour installing Arch
linux on it. Modern computer presses on UEFI boot even more intensely. So it has
to be given a try. Turned out to be easy on a fresh installation though.

Here's what I did:

1. Created a GPT partition table instead of MBR
2. Allocated a partition for EFI: [wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/EFI_System_Partition)
3. Ensured it's mounted under `/boot`
4. Installed [`systemd-boot`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd-boot) with `bootctl install`
5. Configured the arch [loader](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-boot#Standard_root_installations).

It worked like a charm on a new laptop. But then I faced a temptation to convert
my Xiaomi mi notebook air from MBR/grub legacy boot to UEFI. Ideally without
loosing data or needing to reinstall the system. It happened to be easy too.
Luckily I had a 8 GB swap partition at the beginning of the storage space.

These were my steps:

1. Dumped partition table for reference
2. Created a new partition table GPT
3. Created data partition with the same start/end as it was in MBR
4. Created an EFI 512 MB partition at the beginning of the storage
5. Created a 7.5 GB swap partition
6. Tweaked file systems, `/etc/fstab`
7. Proceeded to the `systemd-boot` installation
8. Finally, removed grub from the system

It seems this setup is more modern and robust.

```
$ LANG=en_US.UTF-8 sudo parted /dev/sda print

Disk /dev/sda: 128GB
