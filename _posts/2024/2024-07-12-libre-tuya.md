I use Home Assistant nowadays to manage electric equipment at home. This is a
remarkable leap forward since my first automation attempts [last year]({%
post_url /2023/2023-01-01-enter-iot %}). I've been using
[ESPHome](https://esphome.io) as custom firmware for Sonoff S26 plugs, which
are based on ubiquitous microcontroller ESP8266. But now it's easier to find
cheaper Tuya 20A smart sockets for as low as 150â‚´ (under 4$) a piece. They are
even equipped with power meter. But the challenge is that they use LibreTiny
chip BK7231N. Here's what I learnt do.

First of all, I tried
[tuya-couldcutter](https://github.com/tuya-cloudcutter/tuya-cloudcutter). While
it could potentially help with my Aubess 20A plug, it failed with my specific
version. Probably, Tuya patched the vulnerability. So I have to open the case to
attach a serial programmator.

To do that without destroying it is a challenge. Unlike Sonoff, these
plugs don't have any screws. Parts of the case are glued and the glue can be
broken by applying pressure gradually to deform the case slightly. Some people
use [clamps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7Aibrhzbs). I succeeded using
entrance door as a leverage.

The pins of the board [C2BS](https://docs.libretiny.eu/boards/cb2s)
([datasheet](https://developer.tuya.com/en/docs/Document/cb2s-module-datasheet))
are easy to identify. I use [IC
clamps](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005936436715.html) from AliExpress
to attach the programmator.

ESPHome configuration could be bootstraped using an online tool
[UPK2ESPHome](https://upk.libretiny.eu/). And finally, to install the firmware,
it's enough to run `esphome run tuya-1.yml`. Conveniently, it suggests how to
connect the programmator, and how to reset the microcontroller while the
flasher waits for connection (grounding the pin CEN). It could take a couple of
attempts because of unstable connections but succeeded eventually.

Now beyond of obvious use of smart switches with Home Assistant, there are a
couple of unexpected opportunities. First of all, this is an embedded software
platform in an elegant case, connected to WiFi network and conveniently powered
from a standard AC socket. Second, BK7231N is capable of BLE communications.
So potentially, [esphome-jk-bms](https://github.com/syssi/esphome-jk-bms) could
be ported from ESP32 to create a cheap and convenient battery monitor.
