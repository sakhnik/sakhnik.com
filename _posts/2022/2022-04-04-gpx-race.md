More than a month into the full-scale
[Russian invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine),
and hard to imagine how life changed dramatically in one night. It's hard to
believe there was a luxury to do recreational orienteering in the forests.
That's where an idea came to me: why not to record some tracks on mobile phones,
take a photo of the map and align the tracks on the map. That'd be a race to
explore. Moreover, it turned out that the club shares the maps in good
resolution, so no need to take photographs. But the map should still be aligned
with the GPS coordinates. That's how the project
[gpx-race](https://github.com/sakhnik/gpx-race) emerged.

It's convenient to create application web interface using
[JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/), which offers lots of ready widgets like file
upload button, [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) map etc.

Finally, when the four markers are aligned on both the image and the
[OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org) map, a perspective projection can be
calculated to orient the orienteering map properly. The final result can be
downloaded as a standalone HTML page.

A lot can be improved in the application both in the functionality and the UX.
For instance, some especially older maps aren't particularly accurate and may
need piecewise affine transform to align by more than four points. But that's
low priority now, unfortunately.
