A year and a half passed since I set up to create a simple
[Neovim](https://neovim.io) UI in C++ in my spare time. The project
[nvim-ui](https://github.com/sakhnik/nvim-ui) evolved into an exciting
experience with quite a bit of discovery, experience and notable conclusions to
share.

## SpyUI in nvim-gdb

First of all, the idea emerged when
[SpyUI](https://github.com/sakhnik/nvim-gdb/blob/master/test/spy_ui.py) was
implemented to support maintenance of my Neovim plugin
[nvim-gdb](https://github.com/sakhnik/nvim-gdb). It'd allow just mirroring and
capturing the UI progression during automatic tests or actual use cases to
simplify bug hunting. Not surprisingly, Neovim itself actively uses a UI client
for automatic testing. The script was embarrassingly simple suggesting that a
full-fledged UI shouldn't be too difficult either.

```

The essential summary of the SpyUI was the data structure that Neovim maintains
to share the UI state. The grid is a matrix of text cells with their
highlighting ID associated: `[[(text, hl_id)] * width] * height`. So the first idea is to
assemble the grid matrix based on the Neovim messages, and process it further
for the best appearance and performance. For instance, concatenate the
subsequent cells with the same `hl_id` into words, and skip the invisible spaces
at all: `[[(width, word, hl_id)]] * height`.

## nvim-ui in SDL2

So the first attempt was with [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/). Surely, it'd
allow achieving superb performance by with hardware acceleration! Pango and
Cairo from the GNOME stack were used to render the text into bitmaps, and
the bitmaps were used to create textures. The prepared textures could be reused
multiple times if that specific piece of text didn't change. One more
way to alleviate CPU usage was throttling of grid flushes. Really, there's no
need to do rendering more frequently than 25 FPS.

It worked decently so the version 0.0.1 was released just to get things started.
Then soon the version 0.0.2 followed with a couple of bugs fixed, a bit of
infrastructure support.

But there was also a significant drawback discovered (issue
[#20](https://github.com/sakhnik/nvim-ui/issues/20)). Let's call it *texture
noise*. And I couldn't find any way to fix it. Apparently, it's attributed to
the GPU rendering.

## Porting to GTK 4

After a bit of research, I decided to try using
[GTK 4](https://blog.gtk.org/2020/12/16/gtk-4-0/) directly. That's because Pango
and Cairo are already used in GTK, first of all. Then GTK would also allow
using widgets for configuration dialogs, for instance, for font selection. And a
lot more. But what's most important, the toolkit recommends using widgets for
all the custom drawing whenever possible. That means that what was a "texture"
in SDL2 could now easily be implemented as a GTK label! Moreover, all the
styling could be conveniently done using CSS, leaving behind very high level
coding.

This is the time when the application got the menu, and the ability to connect to
a remote Neovim instance. The performance was OK, except when there was a lot of
little labels to be created at once. For example, when getting a listing of
digraphs with `:digraphs`, around 1,500 labels would be created and placed on
the grid on every PgUp/PgDn. This took a noticeable delay of 0.3 seconds.

## Enter Gir2cpp

That version wasn't released immediately because I realized that GTK's C API is a bit
cumbersome and unpleasant. For example, one should know in beforehand that
GtkEntry implements Editable:

```C++
auto t = gtk_editable_get_text(GTK_EDITABLE(entry));
```
instead of the conventional
```C++
auto t = entry.get_text();
```

Bringing in gtkmm seemed an overkill for just a handful of widgets I was
intending to use. But one idea seemed appealing:
[cppgir](https://gitlab.com/mnauw/cppgir) uses GObject
[introspection](https://gi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to generate C++ wrappers.
Unfortunately, I failed to use it properly. It didn't seem too complicated to
create own ad-hoc generator of C++ wrappers for GObject-based libraries. So
there's another auxiliary side project that could potentially has it's own
application: [gir2cpp](https://github.com/sakhnik/gir2cpp).

It's just a Python library that needs to be properly configured with the
white and black list of desired symbols to be wrapped in C++. Unfortunately, I
wasn't able to find a way to seamlessly integrate it into the Meson build
system. Perhaps because it's actually isn't known what exactly files are going
to be generated given the required configuration. So it's utilized as a
preconfiguration step before the build system is invoked:
[prepare-gtkpp.sh](https://github.com/sakhnik/nvim-ui/blob/ef35eb7a3a0ab40a9f4c8b9071a7bc801eb93955/scripts/prepare-gtkpp.sh).

However quick and dirty the approach is, the code improved significantly:

```C++
Texture t{row, Gtk::Label::new_("").g_obj()};
t.label.set_markup(text.c_str());
t.label.set_sensitive(false);
t.label.set_can_focus(false);
t.label.set_focus_on_click(false);
t.label.get_style_context().add_provider(_css_provider.get(), GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_APPLICATION);
_grid.put(t.label, 0, y);
```


Coping with the performance issues.
Too frequent flushes.
Having fine-grained widgets has a couple of drawbacks:

* `:digraphs` performance is horrible, it takes a noticeable 1/3 of a second to
    draw a page
* it's challenging to align vertical lines perfectly in Telescope.

So there we are after 1.5 years of experimentation.
The strengths:

* Simplicity of the idea
* Potential for implementing more features
* Solid foundation
