A year and a half passed since I set off to create a simple
[Neovim](https://neovim.io) UI in C++ in my spare time. The project
[nvim-ui](https://github.com/sakhnik/nvim-ui) became an exciting journey with
quite a bit of discovery, experience and notable conclusions to
share.

## SpyUI in nvim-gdb

First of all, the idea emerged when
[SpyUI](https://github.com/sakhnik/nvim-gdb/blob/master/test/spy_ui.py) was
implemented to support maintenance of my Neovim plugin
[nvim-gdb](https://github.com/sakhnik/nvim-gdb). SpyUI would allow just mirroring and
capturing the UI progression during automatic tests or actual use cases to
simplify bug hunting. Not surprisingly, Neovim itself actively uses a UI client
for automatic testing. The script was embarrassingly simple suggesting that a
full-fledged UI shouldn't be too difficult either.

+----------------------------------------+
```

The essential summary of the SpyUI was the data model that Neovim maintains
to share the UI state. The grid is a matrix of text cells with their
highlighting ID associated: `[[(text, hl_id)] * width] * height`. So the first idea is to
assemble the grid matrix based on the Neovim messages, and process it further
for the best appearance and performance. For instance, concatenate the
adjacent cells with the same `hl_id` into words, and skip the invisible spaces
at all: `[[(stride, word, hl_id)]] * height`.

## nvim-ui in SDL2

So the first attempt was with [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/). Surely, it'd
allow achieving superb performance by with hardware acceleration! Pango and
Cairo from the GNOME stack were used to render the text into bitmaps, and
the bitmaps were transformed into textures. The prepared textures could be reused
multiple times if that specific piece of text didn't change. One more
way to relieve the CPU usage was throttling of grid flushes. Really, there's no
need to do rendering more frequently than 25 FPS.

It worked decently so the version 0.0.1 was released just to get things started.
Then soon the version 0.0.2 followed with a couple of bugs fixed, a bit of
development infrastructure automatated.

But there was also a significant drawback discovered (issue
[#20](https://github.com/sakhnik/nvim-ui/issues/20)). Let's call it *texture
noise*. And I couldn't find any way to fix it. Apparently, it's attributed to
the GPU rendering.

## Porting to GTK 4

After a bit of research, I decided to try using
[GTK 4](https://blog.gtk.org/2020/12/16/gtk-4-0/) directly. That's because Pango
and Cairo are already part of GTK, first of all. Then GTK would also allow
using ready widgets for configuration dialogs, for instance, for font selection.
And a lot more. But what's most important, the toolkit recommends using stock
widgets for all the custom drawing whenever possible. That means that what was a
"texture" in SDL2 could now easily be implemented as a GTK label! Moreover, all
the styling could be conveniently done using CSS, leaving behind very low level
coding.

This is the time when the application got the menu, and the ability to connect to
a remote Neovim instance. The performance was OK, except when there was a lot of
little labels to be created at once. For example, when getting a listing of
digraphs with `:digraphs`, around 1,500 labels would be created and placed on
the grid on every PgUp/PgDn. This caused a noticeable delay of 0.3 seconds.

## Enter Gir2cpp

That version wasn't released immediately because I realized that GTK's C API is
a bit cumbersome and unpleasant. For example, one should know in beforehand that
the class GtkEntry implements the interface Editable:

```C++
auto t = gtk_editable_get_text(GTK_EDITABLE(entry));
```
instead of the conventional
```C++
auto t = entry.get_text();
```

Bringing in gtkmm seemed an overkill for just a handful of widgets I was
intending to use. But one idea seemed particularly appealing:
[cppgir](https://gitlab.com/mnauw/cppgir) uses GObject
[introspection](https://gi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to generate C++ wrappers.
Unfortunately, I failed to build the code with it properly. It didn't seem too
complicated to create an custom ad-hoc generator of C++ wrappers for
GObject-based libraries. So there's another auxiliary side project that could
potentially has it's own application:
[gir2cpp](https://github.com/sakhnik/gir2cpp).

It's just a Python library that needs to be properly configured with the
white and black list of desired symbols to be wrapped in C++. Unfortunately, I
wasn't able to find a way to seamlessly integrate it into the Meson build
system. Perhaps because it actually isn't known what exactly files are going
to be generated given the required configuration. So it's utilized as a
preconfiguration step before the Meson build system is invoked:
[prepare-gtkpp.sh](https://github.com/sakhnik/nvim-ui/blob/ef35eb7a3a0ab40a9f4c8b9071a7bc801eb93955/scripts/prepare-gtkpp.sh).

However quick and dirty the approach is, the code improved significantly:

```C++
Texture t{row, Gtk::Label::new_("").g_obj()};
t.label.set_markup(text.c_str());
t.label.set_sensitive(false);
t.label.set_can_focus(false);
t.label.set_focus_on_click(false);
t.label.get_style_context().add_provider(_css_provider.get(), GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_APPLICATION);
_grid.put(t.label, 0, y);
```

## Dealing with the performance issues

Fine-grained labels/textures are perfect to minimize the redrawing work, but
display a couple of significant drawbacks. The most annoying one is
that there can be lots of labels to update when listing messages (see
`:digraphs`). Another one is the horizontal alignment of separate textures,
especially thin vertical lines in the adjacent lines in
[telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim).

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/511855.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/511855)

So I tried to simplify the renderer to create only one big label for one grid
row. This makes the data model a bit more complex, but simplifies the code a
lot: `[[(text, hl_id)] * cols] * rows` â†’ `[[(word, hl_id)]] * rows`.
Specifically, the text layout is now done using Pango markup. This turned out to
be a great idea for both the UI appearance and responsiveness and code
maintainability.

## Perspective

So here we are after 1.5 years of experimentation.
There's an ongoing project, a Neovim UI with the following features:

* Simplicity of the idea and C++ implementation
* Decent appearance and performance
* Solid foundation for implementing more features
* A good sandbox for further experiments.

To be continued.
