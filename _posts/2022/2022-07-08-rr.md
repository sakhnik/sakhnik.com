It was a year ago in a [nvim-gdb](https://github.com/sakhnik/nvim-gdb) issue
[#151](https://github.com/sakhnik/nvim-gdb/issues/151) that I discovered
[rr](https://rr-project.org/). It promised to allow recording a program
execution once, and debugging that run multiple times exactly the same way.
Finally, there turned up an occasion to try it in the real life, and to
implement the suggestion in the issue.

The task at hand was to investigate how [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) calculates
the video frames presentation timestamps for some compressed video stream.
That's what can be seen by executing ffprobe:

```bash
ffprobe -loglevel -8 -i test.mp4 -select_streams v -show_entries packet=pts | grep pts | head
pts=1
pts=4
pts=2
pts=3
pts=7
pts=5
pts=6
```

It looks like the sequence of frames is I-P-B-B-P-B-B etc. It makes perfect
sense. But where does the number 1 for the first frame come from? It can be
traced by following the memory assignment backward in the history. So let's
record the execution of ffprobe:

```bash
$ rr record ffprobe -loglevel -8 -i stream.mpd -select_streams v -show_entries packet=pts                
rr: Saving execution to trace directory `/home/sakhnik/.local/share/rr/ffprobe-4'.
[PACKET]
pts=1
[/PACKET]
[PACKET]
pts=3
[/PACKET]
[PACKET]
pts=2
[/PACKET]
```

Then the debugging can be started by just typing `rr replay`. But it's worth
doing that in `nvim-gdb` to enable proper code navigation and highlighting.
There's a demo of how I did it:
