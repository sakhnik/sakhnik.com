Here is the technology to easily configure virtual private network for direct
P2P access. Consider you need to access a server that's located behind a
firewall. Consider direct communication channel is preferable to forwarding via
a central point. Consider a cross-platform support is needed. The answer to all
this requirements is [tinc VPN](https://www.tinc-vpn.org/).

Possible applications:

* Secure access to the home network (IoT)
* Access to a server with 3G connection to the internet behind firewall
