Here is the issue: I'm running [i3](https://i3wm.org/) on the desktop, but still
need to have GNOME [Evolution](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evolution) to work
with different email accounts. Evolution is configured in [GNOME Online
Accounts](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeOnlineAccounts), but
unfortunately GNOME control center wouldn't start properly in a bare i3 session.
The solution is easy: `env XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=GNOME gnome-control-center`. It's
also worth creating an alias for that command.
