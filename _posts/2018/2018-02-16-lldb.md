The plugin [nvim-gdb](https://github.com/sakhnik/nvim-gdb) (see
[introduction]({% post_url /2017/2017-08-20-nvim-gdb %})) now supports both
[GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) and [LLDB](https://lldb.llvm.org/).

I need a debugger very seldom, so the project remained silent for a while.
But it seems to attract some attention and thus the first [feature
request](https://github.com/sakhnik/nvim-gdb/issues/1) came. The plugin is
really easy to extend due to its extreme simplicity. So there were no reason to
refuse.

It also turned out that LLDB is a really fascinating tool.
