Just to keep in mind, there are a couple of caveats: scenery, keyboard and
"Bad conversion".

If the simulation starts in the middle of the ocean, you are missing scenery
files. The easiest way to fix would be to let it download automatically as
needed.

If the keyboard seems not to work, make sure you had US layout before launching
`fgfs`. Probably, you could test the layout inside the `fgrun`, and switch it if
needed.

If the fatal error "Bad conversion" fires up, the application may be struggling
with the Cyrillic path to the scenery. Make sure that the scenery is downloaded
into a convenient short path written with Latin characters. Also, copy the
`%APPDATA%` from `c:\Program Files\FlightGear` into the directory with the
scenery.

Fly safely!
