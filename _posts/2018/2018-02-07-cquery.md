I've put a lot of effort to get
[YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) and
[rtags](https://github.com/Andersbakken/rtags) configured and running:
[deployed compactly]({% post_url /2016/2016-11-03-ycm-deployment %}), [updated
automatically]({% post_url /2017/2017-01-14-automatic-ycm-update %}), [adapted
to vim]({% post_url /2017/2017-01-08-vim-rtags %}), [managed]({% post_url
/2017/2017-08-12-cproj %}). And they served well until I found a better solution:
language server protocol ([LSP](https://langserver.org)). It turns out to be as
robust as simple to configure nowadays.

To get it running, just few steps were needed:

* Install [cquery](https://github.com/cquery-project/cquery), a package for
which is available in AUR: [cquery](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cquery/)

* Install and configure an LSP
[client](https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim) for neovim

* Install and configure [deoplete](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim),
[neosnippet](https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet.vim).

There are two ways to configure a project: either placing a file named `.cquery`
in the project root, which must be convenient for simpler projects, or leaving
`compile_commands.json` in the project root. While the latter is usually
generated with cmake (`-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=Yes`), the former can
easily be crafted with a pair of commands (see
[cquery-init](https://github.com/sakhnik/dotfiles/blob/master/src/.bin/cquery-init)).

The setup allows to get whatever is needed for development in C++:

* code completion
* code navigation
* on-the-fly check
* symbol search
* symbol renaming

Thus, it's safe to remove YCM and rtags now.
