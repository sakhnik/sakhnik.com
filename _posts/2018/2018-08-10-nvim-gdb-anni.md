The first commit to [nvim-gdb]({% post_url /2017/2017-08-20-nvim-gdb %})
happened the 16th of August, 2017. So I may safely assume that it's the
first anniversary. The project has grown beyond my expectations really. So let's
review most notable milestones in its development.


Overview
--------

Essentially, there is only a handful of requirements to a debugger plugin:

* Show the backend CLI
* Show source code with current frame location in a Vim window
* Show breakpoint locations in the source code
* Handle various short keys for the debugger commands `next`, `step`, `finish`
  etc.

And the nvim-gdb does exactly that, but no more. It is assumed that all the
other features are supported by the debugger backend. Like saving breakpoints,
reviewing debugging history, assembly, registers, memory, you name it!


Diverse backends
----------------

It started as a ingenious thin wrapper around GDB to facilitate development of
Neovim: [neovim_gdb.vim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/25356f2802b5b98efe7f0d6661979b0a919c4d2d/contrib/gdb/neovim_gdb.vim).
 It turns out that GDB isn't always
available (see the [feature
request](https://github.com/sakhnik/nvim-gdb/issues/1#issue-296286720)).
But the same idea could be applied to any CLI debugger, I thought. â€”Yes, and thus
[`:GdbStartLLDB`]({% post_url 2018/2018-02-16-lldb %}) was introduced.

Then later on, when much of functionality was implemented in Python already, I
needed to step through the test. So I step aside for a short time, and got PDB
harnessed too. Although it behaves a little bit differently, yet still it's
completely usable.

Accurate breakpoints
--------------------

While it's easy to handle user hitting `<f8>`, it's not so easy when a
breakpoint is set with a CLI command. One can setup a one-hit temporary
breakpoint, a conditional breakpoint and a lot more. And a breakpoint may
resolve to multiple places in the source code.

To show breakpoint signs in the source code accurately, the plugin would query
breakpoint locations for the current file on every stop. On the other hand, the
user shouldn't be annoyed with unexpected debugger output, and the debugging
history should be rather untouched. It's done separately for different backends.

LLDB allows to spawn a thread, which would run a side channel for service
commands like `info breakpoints`.  GDB doesn't seem to allow that, but it's easy
to bypass command history with prefix `server`. And the interaction with it can
be filtered out with a wrapper proxy application. So that's how it worked out!


Careful UI
----------

It was really easy to mess beyond reparation in the original plugin. Close a
window, go to another tab while debugging etc. But now it's a different story.
The behaviour has been polished, any global state has been isolated to the
debugging tab. So it's even possible to conduct a couple of independent
sessions simultaneously.

Keymaps have also been reworked. They are defined and undefined dynamically
depending on in which window the focus is. So if the debugging tab is left, you
wouldn't be able to step through the code. Likewise, nvim-gdb's keymaps wouldn't
mess your own keymaps like [`ctrl-p`](https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim).


Test suite
----------

This is by far the most useful part to ensure practical stability of the plugin.
The basic operation is tested carefully for all the backends. One now can be
sure that whatever change is made wouldn't introduce straight forward
regressions while the tests are passing.

The same tests are run by Travis CI:
[nvim-gdb](https://travis-ci.org/sakhnik/nvim-gdb).  The very recent addition
was support for Darwin, so that the continuous integration is run for both Linux
and Darwin. I was lucky to get it running without any MacOS, by the way!

Wrap up
-------

Frankly speaking, I don't need the debugger that often. But now I have one ready
in my hands at all times. Surely, the development will continue. New features
will be added, the existing ones will be polished. Please feel free to open
issues or offer pull requests if anything is needed.
