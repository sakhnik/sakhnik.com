It turned out that every laptop I owned happened to need custom kernel
eventually. For instance, [Acer
C720](https://www.acer.com/ac/en/CA/content/series/c720) had a less popular
light sensor, HP needed a specific version of WiFi driver etc. And this time,
[Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air](http://xiaomi-mi.com/notebooks/xiaomi-mi-notebook-air-125-silver),
doesn't work well with the kernels younger than 4.10, the touchpad becomes
unbearable jerky. Luckily there is an AUR package with LTS kernel
[linux-lts49](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-lts49/). Unfortunately,
it can't be built in `tmpfs` because of limited size. But it turns out
that building minimal kernels is very easy in Arch linux indeed.

First, there is a service recording the names of kernel modules that were ever
loaded in the system:
[modprobed-db](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Modprobed-db). It also
allows interactive usage.

Second, one line needs be put into `PKGBUILD`:
```sh
make LSMOD=$HOME/.config/modprobed.db localmodconfig
```
This will configure the kernel build to only include specific needed modules.

The result is impressing:
* The build finishes within 15 minutes (much less than I sent writing text)
* Fits into 2 GB `/tmp` with much to spare
* The kernel is fully functional
* Easy to keep it up to date
