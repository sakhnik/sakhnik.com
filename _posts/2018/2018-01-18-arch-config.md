It turns out that tracking tweaks to the system, Arch Linux in my case, is a
common concern. And it has already been solved by
[aconfmgr](https://github.com/CyberShadow/aconfmgr). This is a shell script,
which calculates what has changed in the system: installed or removed packages;
added, removed or changed files. 

I believe this is a good opportunity to ease management of my laptop. So there I
have it: [arch-config](https://github.com/sakhnik/arch-config). It will
naturally complement my earlier attempt to manage
[dotfiles](https://github.com/sakhnik/dotfiles).
