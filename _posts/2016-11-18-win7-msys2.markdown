Let's face it, after 9 years on linux exclusively, I feel helpless in windows.
Navigation, search, editing, and processing files is very easy and natural
in unix: you may know just
[few commands](http://freeengineer.org/learnUNIXin10minutes.html), and they
way to build [pipelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)) out of
them.

Fortunately, I remembered that I used to utilize
[MSYS](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS) in the past.
So I tried to install it this time. Surprisingly, it comes with famous
[pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman) as a package manager. So
finally I felt like home: `zsh`, `tmux`, `mc` and `vim` are available in their
repository and practically work like in linux.

Consequences:

* I can stay really productive now concentrating on product development
* I removed bunch of beautiful, but useless programs like [Far
   manager](https://www.farmanager.com/), [console
   emulator](https://conemu.github.io/), archiver etc
* I can now easily switch between linux and windows environments for
cross-platform development 
* I had to abandon QEMU KVM, because apparently VirtualBox handles MSYS's
[mintty](https://mintty.github.io/) much better.
