I feel I need to carefully write my steps on configuring development
environment or system instead of keeping everything in my head. Let me try to
publish my notes to the web. Hope, search engines will pick them up eventually.

{% highlight C++ %}
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello, world!\n";
}
{% endhighlight %}

Stay tuned.
