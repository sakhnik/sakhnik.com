I've been using hand-crafted [.zshrc](https://github.com/sakhnik/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc~)
for few years with very little change. Now it appeared to slow down zsh startup
on [msys]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2016/2016-11-18-win7-msys2.md %}).
I pinpointed out the cause: `which` searches had to traverse tons of directories
in the `PATH`. Then I decided to rework the whole configuration, there should have
been something similar to [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for ZSH.

Starting from Arch [wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/zsh),
I run into [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen), then
[antibody](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody). But continued searching
until on the page [awesome-zsh-plugins](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins)
I found the exhaustive list of available zsh frameworks. My choice
is now [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug): fast, pleasant and seem
to be popular enough.

So what I did now:

* Started [`.zshrc`](https://github.com/sakhnik/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc) from scratch.
* Chose prompt [Pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure), which checks git status asynchronously (!).
* Restored what I needed for productivity: shortcuts, functions, zsh settings etc.
* Changed searching with `which` to checking for programs in well-known places.

Now the config will be easier to maintain, keep up to date and extend, hopefully.
And yes, it does load much faster!
