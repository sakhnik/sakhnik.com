I've been using LGE webOS smart TV since 2014. It has been working seemingly
well. Except for some nuissances like inability to play
[Classic FM](https://www.classicfm.com).
Raspberry Pi 4 with 8 GB RAM seems a good choice for a smart TV set-top box.
But here is the issue: hardware accelerated video decoding only works
in a 32-bit OS that can only operate 4GB RAM at most. It's more than just trading
precious RAM for CPU cycles, videos don't play smoothly at all.

So here is how I set it up with very little to no compromise:

- Install `aarch64` [Manjaro](https://www.manjaro.org/downloads/arm/raspberry-pi-4/arm8-raspberry-pi-4-xfce/)
- Setup a 32-bit raspios container to run hardware-accelerated VLC, as well as
other Raspberry Pi goodies like Wolfram Mathematica
- Create a couple of bash scripts to simplify launching contained applications.
