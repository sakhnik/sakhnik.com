When I needed to have portable win7 installation for my work at Luxoft,
suitable running on my
[Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air](http://xiaomi-mi.com/notebooks/xiaomi-mi-notebook-air-125-silver),
I decided to use [KVM](http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page).
Many benchmarks found in the web showed that it would be really good.
However, it took a while to figure out usable deployment.

The best manual I found in the Arch Wiki: [QEMU](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/QEMU).
It's detailed enough to go through it from end to end to decide what
options would serve best. Thus, I ended up using virtio for most hardware
and QXL for graphics. Finally, [SPICE](http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/SPICE)
was what turned user experience into real pleasure with proper key grabbing,
clipboard exchange etc.

Without further ado, there is my launch script:
[win7_64](https://bitbucket.org/sakhnik/win7_64).
